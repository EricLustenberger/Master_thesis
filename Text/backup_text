The Distribution of Wealth in a Life-Cycle Model with Durables

Investigate empirical predictions of the life-cycle incomplete markets model (Gourinchas and Parker, 2002; Cagetti, 2003; Castañeda et al., 2003; Kaplan and Violante, 2010; Yang, 2009,), thus contribute to the literature that “demonstrate that a plausibly parameterized version of their models can quantitatively explain empirical findings as arising from rational choices of consumers facing an increasing wage profile and income uncertainty”.
The model is based on the classic income-fluctuation problem in which the consumer faces a stochastic income process and decides in every period how much to save and how much to consume. Important contributions to the literature are Deaton (1991), Carroll (1992,1997), Gourinchas and Parker (2002). “Following Bewley (1986), this problem has been embedded by Huggett (1993) and Aiyagari (1994) into a general equilibrium framework, giving rise to the endogenous determination of the interest rate as well as a nontrivial income, wealth, and consumption distribution at equilibrium. “
Furthermore, this paper relates to other literature such as: 
Endogenous borrowing constraint: The specification of the borrowing constraint  in FV&K(2011) is adapted from the recent endogenous incomplete-markets literature: Kehoe and Levine (1993), Kocherlakota (1996), Krueger and Perri (1999, 2006), and Alvarez and Jermann (2000). Lustig (2004) also has a model with durable assets and an endogenous borrowing constraint to explain the equity premium puzzle, however agents have full access to Arrow securities and are infinitely lived.
Literature on optimal portfolio choice in the presence of consumer durables: Grossman and Laroque (1990), Eberly (1994), Chah et al. (1995), and Flavin and Yamashita (2002).

The life-cycle model

My model is a life-cycle model where agents chose between non-durable consumption and durable consumption as well as a liquid asset in each period.  The one period bond serves as insurance against income shocks, whereas the durable provides, both insurance against the idiosyncratic risk as well as collateral value. Moreover, durable consumption is directly modeled into the utility function. 

Four key patterns of the model (Fernandez- Villaverde and Krueger, 2011):
a)	a highly persisten stochastic idiosyncratic labor-income process
b)	b) a hump-shaped mean over the life cycle
c)	the presence of durables that yield consumption services and can be used as collateral, in addition to a standard one-period bond whose short sales are subject to a borrowing constraint
d)	 endogenous determination of the interest rate in general equilibrium 

The Income pattern: 
See Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) and Hansen (1993). 
-	although use different approach here 

Justification of c) 
-	the presence of durables is motivated by empirical observation that they constitute a large fraction of households’ asset holdings 
-	moreover life-cycle pattern of nondurable consumption may be intimately related to the life-cycle pattern of the accumulation of durables (avstraction may severely bias study of life-cycle profile of nondurable consumption and asset accumulation) 

Endogenously determined interest rate in GE
-	life-cycle profile of consumption and asset accumulation depends crucially on ratio between subjective time-discount factor and interest rate

Why is it important to model durables? 

Life-Cycle Profiles

Contrary to the standard life-cycle model  with complete financial markets, where individuals smooth consumption over their lifetimes and across states of the world, consumption over the life is hump shaped, even after controlling for family size (Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger, 2011). Understanding this puzzle is important from an applied policy analysis. Changing individual behavior over the life cycle implies that social security reforms, public provision of saving incentives, or welfare consequences of progressive taxation will vary by age groups. 
Furthermore, the life-cycle patter of households’ portfolio composition demands a model that includes an explicit formulation of the purchase decisions on consumer durables. It is thus problematic to omit this modeling choice (sucha as Carroll (1997) or Gourinchas and Parker (2002), who rely on hh consuming up to the age of 40 all of their imcome apart from a small buffer to insure against future bad income shocks) when nondurable and durable consumption interact in a nonseparable way. 
As Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) put forward, consumers accumulate durables early in life and consume the rest of disposable income, without any saving in financial assets since durables provide consumption service flows, as well as collateralizable insurance against uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk. 

The literature 

Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) point out two key patterns of consumption and asset holdings over the life cycle. Namely, Consumption expenditures on both durable and nondurable goods are hump-shaped over the life-cycle and young households keep very few liquid assets and hold most of their wealth in consumer durables, while they accumulate more financial assets to save for retirement later in life. They show that “the interaction between consumer durables that provide both consumption and collateral services and endogenous borrowing constraints gives rise to accumulation of durables (and no accumulation of financial assets) early in life and substitution toward higher consumption of nondurables and the accumulation of financial assets later in life. “ 

Their discussion is part of a larger literature. One one part the literature studying the interaction of household nondurable consumption choices and consumer durables. Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2007) and Yang (2009) provide empirical evidence on expenditures for consumer durables over the life cycle. Moreover: Martin (2003), Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006), Li and Yao (2007), Diaz and Luego-Prado (2008), Kiyotaki et al. (2008), and Iacoviello and Pavan (2009) are also important papers. 

Secondly, the importance of housing for the accumulation of wealth and for portfolio composition is a theme dealt by an important part of the literature. Grossman and Laroque (1990) and Berkovec and Fullerton (1992), Gervais (2002), Gruber and Martin (2003), Martin and Gruber (2004), Cocco (2005), Nakajima (2005), Yao and Thang (2005), Silos (2007a, 2007b), Diaz and Luego-Prado, and HIntermaier and Koeniger (2009). 

Thirdly, the role as collateral of consumer durables in general and housing in particular. A theme of recent literature focusing on the joint housing and mortgage choice. For example Hurst and Stafford (2004), Luengo-Prado (2006), Chambers et al. (2009a, 2009b). Moreover, a small and growing literature on structural models of forecolusers within this context: Jeske and Krueger (2005) and Garriga and Schlagenhauf (2009). Carroll and li (2008. Finally papers attempting to estimate models of housing choice: Sanchez (2997), Bahari et al. (2008) and Li et al. (2009).

The consumption pattern

Empirical evidence from Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011)
-	They use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to show that consumption expenditure on nondurable consumption follows a hump-shape pattern over the life cycle. 
-	Further empirical literature about the life-cycle profile of consumption observed in cross-sectional micro data: Blundell et al. (1994), Attanasio and Browning (1995), Attanasio and Weber (1995), Gourinchas and Parker (2002). 
-	The Key question in FV&K(2011): Does consumption still follow a hump-shaped life-cycle profile, once changes in family size are controlled for? 
-	Their key finding is that the hump exists for nondurable as well as durable expenditure
-	Empirical evidence: 
o	Traditional prediction of a life-cycle model with complete financial markets: “life-cycle consumption profiles should be smooth. Namely, if the period utility function is time-invariant and the time discount factor is constant, households will choose consumption plans to equate marginal utility across time and states of the world, possibly with some growth rate, depending on the relative size of the real interest rate and the discount factor. Under CRRA (Constant Relative Risk Aversion), period utility consumption growth itself should be constant across time. With complete markets, consumption smoothing can be achieved through the transfer of contingent claims across periods and states. ( this statement relies on the further assumption that leisure and consumption are separable in the period utility function. For instance, Ghez and Becker (1973) propose a model where consumption services are produced with time and consumption goods as inputs. When time becomes more expensive (i.e., labor income is higher), agents substitute goods for time in the production function of consumer services, generating a correlation between labor income and consumption.)“ 
•	The first empirical question answered in Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2011) hence, looks at household-level consumption data and seeks to confirm that consumption is smooth over the life-cycle. 
•	Deaton (1992) provides an overview for the literature answering this question. “The main stylized fact emerging in this literature was that consumption seems to track income over the life cycle, changing only when income changes and not when it becomes known that income will change, as economic theory predicts. -> was interpreted as indication for liquidity constraints or other financial market imperfections.  
•	Blundell et al. (1994), Attanasio and Browning (1995) and Attanasio et al. (1999) argue that if one adjusted the consumption data for changes in household size (which is also hump-shaped over the life-cycle) and composition the hump in life cycle consumption disappears. FV&K (2011) challenge this view and argue that consumption follows a hump even after controlling for demographics. 

Other literature:
-	Dotsey_et_al(2014), look at difference between life-cycle expenditure and life-cycle production (Aguiar and Hurst (2007b) make a similar point). They look at heterogeneity in consumption (Aguiar and Hurst (2013)), contrary to the approach, where one only looks at aggregate consumption
o	Consider a modified model of FV&K(2011) and Yang (2009)
o	Support FV&K (2011) in the sense that collateralized borrowing constraints and the income features are responsible for the increasing consumption profiles in the early part of a hh’s life cycle
o	Their explanation of the consumption hump: “ Expecting to have much higher earnings in the future, young households would like to borrow to finance their current consumption but they are borrowing constrained. This explains why, early in life, consumption of all categories increases. Later in life, households start to decrease overall consumption due to the fact that they are discounting future consumption by more as they age and face a lower survival rate. Additionally, older households substitute home consumption for market consumption. The demand for housing in the model matches well the empirical profiles, increasing rapidly early in life and downsizing slowly later in life. Households start with little housing stock. Because of the existence of borrowing constraints and the role of housing as collateral, however, they forgo other consumption and build their housing stock rather quickly. This trend continues until they reach age 65. After that, the housing stock starts to decline slowly because of transactions costs and the increase in home hours, which are complements to the home input and housing in home production. Further, older homeowners are less likely than young ones to move and incure the accompanying transactions costs, because they gave a shorter expected life span and hence house tenure.” 
o	The distpersion of consumption:
•	Consumption dispersion over the life cycle. “Model captures the consumption inequalities up to age 62 reasonabley well. After that, out model implies much smaller standard errors than the data. This result largely comes from our assumption that everyone receives the same social security payment ager age 62 regardless of his income history. (might be different in my model)“

•	Look at different variations of the model. May serve as basis for different analysis, as for example the impact of adjustment costs 
-	Pagel (2017)
o	“Incorporates expectations-based reference-dependent preferences into a dynamic stochastic model to explain three major life-cycle consumption facts:
•	lagged consumption responses to income shocks.
•	Hump-shape consumption profile – early in life, consumption is low due to a first-order precautionary-savings motive, as uncertainty resolves, this motive is dominated by time-inconsistent overconsumption, forcing consumption to decline toward the end of life
•	Consumption drops at retirement – when uncertainty is absent, the agent does not overconsume because he dislikes the associated certain loss in future consumption.

The asset-choice pattern

The model explanation 

Expenditure for consumer durables over the life cycle: 
-	Fernandez-Villaverde and Krueger (2007) and Yang (2009) 
o	FV&K(2011)
•	use data from Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to show that consumption expenditure on durables follows a hump-shape pattern over the life cycle. 
•	Use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to show that young hh own virtually no liquid financial assets but hold a major fraction of their wealth portfolios as durables, whereas later in life the composition of hh portfolios shifts in favor of financial assets 
o	Other sources for the life-cycle profile of assets:
•	 Iacoviello&Pavan(2013) 
•	Dotsey_et_al(2014): “ housing adjustment costs contribute to the slow decline in the home ownership rate and the value of the housing stock owned as households age as in Yang (2009”
•	Life-cycle aggregate: “households start with little wealth. They expect to have much higher earnings, and thus do not save much. During the early part of their lives, households borrow as much as possible to buy houses and save in the form of housing. As time progresses, households start to increase their financial asset holdings. The peak of the financial asset holding is reached at age 60. Agerwards, households start to run down their assets to finance consumption. Without bequest or precautionary saving motives, old households in our model run down their financial assets much more quickly than in the data (De Nardi et al. (2010) show that the risk of incurring substantial medical expenses generates precautionary savings and affects the wealth profile late in life).”
