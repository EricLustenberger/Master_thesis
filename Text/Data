Definitions of Wealth with variable names from STATA -code
===========================================================

Net financial wealth  (netfinworth) = Gross financial wealth (finworth) – Total Debt (totdebt)

Gross financial wealth (finworth) = money in checking accounts (checking) + saving accounts (savings) + money-market accounts (mmacc) + money-market mutual funds (mmfunds) + call accounts in brokerages (cacc)
+ certificates of deposit (cdep) + bonds  (bonds) + account-type pension plans (penacc + currpen + futpen) + thrift accounts (thrift) + current value of life insurance (cvallife) + savings bonds (savbonds) + other managed funds (manfunds) + other financial assets (othfina)+ stock (stocks) + mutual funds (mfunds) + owned non-financial business assets (othnfin) + jewelry, antiques or small durables (buseq)

(where liquid assets (liqasset) = money in checking accounts (checking) + saving accounts (savings) + money-market accounts (mmacc) + money-market mutual funds (mmfunds) + call accounts in brokerages (cacc) ) 

Total Debt (totdebt) = mortgage and housing debt (morthel) + other lines of credit (othloc) and debt on residential (otherdebt) and non-residential property (othresnresdebt) + debt on non-financial business assets (busdebt)
+ credit-card debt (ccbal) + installment loans (install) + pension loans and margin loans (odebt)

Durables (durable) = value of homes (primres) +residential property (othres) + non-residential property (othnres) + vehicles (vehicl)

Total wealth = Net financial wealth (netfinworth_eric) + Durables (durable)


Sample Selection 
================
•	Change w.r.t H&K 2016 :  sample not corrected for unsecured debt is larger than 10 in terms of the sample average of disposable labor income (one additional observation in the SCF 2004 is deleted) 
o	Thus following H&K 2011 and 2010

Open questions: 
===============
note prime age sample: retricting attention to hh with hh head between age 20 and 55! 
Note different adjustment for initial distribution! 
- can either be done in matlab = more flexibility for calibrating growth factor, or directly in stata
-> has to be done in matlab
make sure that you have understood the sample, since full sample is 5* the actual sample (?)
